Z lake
======

Goals:
1. Convert data input attributes to Z records;
2. Query/processing the data as Z stream;
3. Write the results to the data output attributes;

The driver runs on a custom image that contains Z dependencies (e.g., zq).

TBD:
* A Z docker image;
* A zlake driver with golang;

Conceptually, the Z lake can be seen as an L7 "data switch."
